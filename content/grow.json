      "content": "How Do I Love Allah? \ud83e\udd32\nLoving Allah is not just a feeling that stays inside your heart.\nReal love shows.\nIt shows in what you say. It shows in what you do. It shows in the little choices you make every single day.\nSo how can you show Allah that you love Him?\n\n1. Worship Only Allah\nThis is the most important thing of all.\nYou pray to Allah alone. You ask help from Allah alone. You don't pray to anyone else \u2014 not to angels, not to prophets, not to any person, alive or dead.\nOnly Allah.\nThis is Tawhid. And it is the foundation of everything.\n\n2. Obey Allah and His Messenger \ufdfa\nWhen you love someone, you listen to them, right?\nIf your parents say \"don't touch the stove,\" you listen because you trust them. You know they want to keep you safe.\nAllah's rules are the same. They protect you. They guide you to what's best for you.\nAnd the Prophet \ufdfa showed us exactly how to follow Allah's guidance \u2014 so we follow his Sunnah too.\nAllah said in the Quran:\n\n\"Say, if you love Allah, then follow me (the Prophet), and Allah will love you.\"\n(Surah Aal-Imran 3:31)\n\nHow beautiful is that? When you follow the Prophet \ufdfa, Allah loves you back!\n\n3. Remember Allah A Lot\nTalk to Allah during your day. Not just during prayer \u2014 all day long.\nSay \"Bismillah\" before you eat.\nSay \"Alhamdulillah\" when something good happens.\nSay \"SubhanAllah\" when you see something amazing.\nThese little words are like seeds you plant in your heart. They keep Allah with you all day long \u2014 from the moment you wake up until you close your eyes at night.\n\n4. Pray Your Salah With Your Heart\nWhen you stand in prayer, you are not just moving and saying words.\nYou are standing in front of Allah \u2014 the King of everything. The Creator of the heavens and the earth. And He is listening to you.\nJust you.\nTry to think about what you're saying. Even if you don't understand all the words yet, know this: you are talking to the One who loves you most.\n\n5. Make Dua \u2014 Talk to Allah Anytime\nYou don't need a special time.\nYou don't need a special place.\nYou can talk to Allah whenever you want.\nTell Him what makes you happy.\nTell Him what scares you.\nTell Him about your day.\nAsk Him for help.\nThank Him for everything.\nHe loves to hear from you. He really, truly does.\n\n6. Learn About Allah\nHere's something amazing: the more you know about Allah, the more you will love Him.\nLearn His beautiful names. Read the Quran. Listen to stories about the Prophet \ufdfa and his companions.\nWhen you understand who Allah really is \u2014 how kind, how merciful, how great He is \u2014 your heart can't help but fill with love.\n\n7. Love What Allah Loves\nAllah loves kindness \u2014 so be kind.\nAllah loves honesty \u2014 so tell the truth.\nAllah loves patience \u2014 so try to be patient.\nAllah loves those who help others \u2014 so look for ways to help.\nWhen you do what Allah loves, you get closer to Him.\nAnd that closeness? It's the sweetest feeling in the world.\n\n8. Stay Away From What Allah Doesn't Like\nIf you love someone, you don't want to upset them.\nAllah doesn't like lying. He doesn't like hurting others. He doesn't like meanness or pride.\nSo try your best to avoid these things \u2014 not because you're scared, but because you love Allah and you don't want to displease Him.\nThat's what real love looks like.\n\nThings to Remember \ud83d\udcab\n\ud83e\udd0d Loving Allah isn't just a feeling \u2014 it's shown through your actions, big and small.\n\ud83e\udd0d Tawhid comes first. Pray to Allah alone. Ask from Allah alone. Always.\n\ud83e\udd0d Following the Prophet \ufdfa is the key to Allah's love. When you follow him, Allah loves you back.\n\ud83e\udd0d Little words like Bismillah, Alhamdulillah, and SubhanAllah keep Allah in your heart all day.\n\ud83e\udd0d You can talk to Allah anytime, anywhere. He is never too busy for you.\n\ud83e\udd0d The more you learn about Allah, the more your love will grow.\n\ud83e\udd0d Do what Allah loves. Stay away from what He doesn't like. That's how love shows.\n\nYa Allah, help me to love You with my whole heart \u2014 and to show that love in everything I say and do. Make me someone who worships only You, follows Your Prophet \ufdfa, and grows closer to You every day. Ameen. \ud83e\udd0d",

We believe exactly what they told us \u2014 no more, no less. We don't make things up or guess. We simply trust what Allah and His Messenger \ufdfa said.\nAnd what they told us is so, so beautiful.\nAllah has many names \u2014 99 beautiful names \u2014 and each one tells us something amazing about who He is. Let's learn a few of them together:\n\nAr-Rahman & Ar-Raheem \u2014 The Most Merciful \ufffdamental\nAllah's mercy is bigger than anything you can ever imagine. Bigger than the sky. Bigger than the ocean. Bigger than the whole universe.\nYou know how your mother loves you? How she takes care of you when you're sick, hugs you when you're sad, and forgives you when you make mistakes?\nAllah told us that He is even more merciful to you than your own mother.\nEven when you do something wrong, Allah doesn't want to punish you \u2014 He wants to forgive you. He's just waiting for you to say sorry and come back to Him.\n\nAl-Khaliq \u2014 The Creator \ud83c\udf38\nLook around you.\nThe tall mountains that touch the clouds. The tiny ants carrying crumbs bigger than themselves. The bright sun that warms your face. The soft rain that makes the flowers grow.\nAllah created all of it. Every leaf. Every drop. Every star.\nAnd out of all His creations \u2014 out of everything in the heavens and the earth \u2014 He made YOU.\nThat means you are special to Him. You're not just anyone. You are someone Allah chose to create.\n\nAs-Samee' \u2014 The All-Hearing \ud83d\udc42\nAllah hears everything.\nWhen you whisper a little prayer at night under your blanket, He hears it. When you're sad and you don't even say words out loud but your heart is hurting inside, He knows. When you say \"Alhamdulillah\" so quietly that no one else can hear, Allah hears every letter.\nYou never have to shout for Allah to hear you. You never have to wait in line. He's always listening \u2014 always.\n\nAl-Baseer \u2014 The All-Seeing \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\nAllah sees everything.\nHe sees when you share your snack with your little brother even though you really wanted it all. He sees when you help your mama without being asked. He sees when you're kind to someone at school and nobody notices.\nEven when no one else is watching, Allah is watching. And He sees your kindness, your effort, your good heart.\nNothing good you do is ever missed. Allah sees it all \u2014 and He loves it.\n\nAl-Wadud \u2014 The Most Loving \ud83d\udc9a\nThis one is so beautiful.\nAllah loves. And He loves to be loved.\nHe loves those who do good. He loves those who are patient. He loves those who trust Him. He loves those who come back to Him again and again.\nAnd He doesn't just love \u2014 He wants you to love Him back.\nImagine that. The Creator of everything, the King of all kings, wants your little heart to love Him. And when you do love Him, He draws even closer to you.\n\nAl-Qareeb \u2014 The Near One \ud83e\udd32\nEven though Allah is above the heavens, above His mighty Throne, in a way that suits His majesty \u2014 He is never far from you.\nWhen you call upon Him, He hears you right away. When you need Him, He's already there. He is with you through His knowledge, His protection, and His care.\nYou don't need to travel anywhere to find Allah. You don't need to wait. Just close your eyes, raise your hands, and talk to Him.\nHe is near. Always near.\n\nThese are just a few of Allah's beautiful names. But even these few are enough to make your heart feel full. Because when you know who Allah is \u2014 how merciful, how loving, how close He is \u2014 you can't help but love Him.\nAnd the best part? He already loves you. \ud83d\udc9a",

Not even a tiny whisper in your heart.\nAllah is with you through His knowledge, His care, and His protection \u2014 wherever you are, whatever you're doing.\nHave you noticed that when you raise your hands to make dua, you naturally look up?

Your heart knows that Allah is above, watching over you with love and mercy.\n\nSo remember: the One who made the stars and the oceans and the mountains \u2014 that same Allah made YOU.

      "content": "## What Does It Mean to Be a Muslim?\n\nBeing a Muslim means you believe in one God \u2014 Allah \u2014 and you try your best to be a good person every single day.\n\nThe word \"Muslim\" actually means someone who listens to Allah and follows His guidance. It's like having the best teacher in the whole universe showing you the right way to live!\n\n### Why Should You Feel Happy About Being Muslim?\n\n## 1. You Have the Best Gift Ever!\nBeing a Muslim is a special gift from Allah. It's not because we're smarter or better than anyone else \u2014 it's because Allah chose to guide us. And for that, we say \"Alhamdulillah\" (which means \"Thank you, Allah!\").\n\n## 2. You Follow the Best Examples\n\nA long, long time ago, there were very good Muslims who lived right after Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa. They were called the Salaf al-Salih \u2014 which means \"the good people who came before us.\" They showed us exactly how to be great Muslims, and we get to learn from them!\n\n## 3. You Have a Superpower Called Tawhid\n\nTawhid means believing that Allah is the ONE and ONLY God. There's no one like Him. He created everything \u2014 the stars, the oceans, the animals, and YOU! When you remember this, you feel strong because you know the Creator of everything loves you and is always with you.\n\n## 4. You Have a Guidebook for Life\n\nImagine having a perfect instruction book that tells you how to be happy, how to treat people, and how to solve any problem. That's what the Quran and the teachings of Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa (called the Sunnah) are! They help you know what to do in every situation.\n\n## 5. You Belong to a Huge Family\nThere are Muslims all around the world \u2014 in every country, speaking different languages, eating different foods \u2014 but all of them are your brothers and sisters in faith. How cool is that?\n\n## What's the Difference Between Good Pride and Bad Pride?\n\nThis is really important to understand!\n\nGood pride is feeling happy and grateful that Allah guided you. It makes you want to be even kinder, more helpful, and closer to Allah.\n\nBad pride (called kibr in Arabic) is when someone thinks they're better than other people. This is a big mistake that Allah doesn't like.\n\nSo remember: Be thankful, not boastful!\n\n## Things to Remember Every Day \ud83d\udcab\n\n\u2728 Say \"Alhamdulillah\" a lot! When you wake up, when you eat, when something good happens \u2014 thank Allah!\n\n\u2728 Allah is always with you. When you're scared, happy, sad, or confused \u2014 talk to Him. He always listens.\n\n\u2728 Be kind to EVERYONE. Muslims and non-Muslims, friends and strangers, people and animals too!\n\n\u2728 Try your best, but don't worry about being perfect. Allah knows you're trying, and He loves that.\n\n\u2728 Learn a little bit every day. Maybe one small thing about how the Prophet \ufdfa lived. Small steps lead to big changes!\n\n## Your Little To-Do List \u2705\n\nHere are some simple things you can start doing:\n\n- Morning: When you wake up, say \"Alhamdulillah\" and thank Allah for a new day\n- Be Helpful: Do one kind thing today without anyone asking you\n- Tell the Truth: Even when it's hard, be honest\n- Pray: Talk to Allah in your prayers and really mean it\n- Learn: Ask a parent or teacher to tell you one story about the Prophet \ufdfa or his companions\n- Bedtime: Before you sleep, think of three things you're thankful for\n\n\n## A Special Reminder Just for You \ud83e\udd32\n\nBeing Muslim isn't about being perfect. It's about trying your best and knowing that Allah sees your effort.\n\nWhen you make mistakes (and everyone does!), just say sorry to Allah, try to do better, and move on. Allah is the Most Merciful \u2014 He loves to forgive.\n\nYou are special. You are loved. And you have the most beautiful gift in the world \u2014 the gift of Islam.\n\nSo smile, be grateful, and shine your light wherever you go!",

It's like the biggest family reunion in the world, where millions of Muslims from every country come together!\nWhat Is the Kaaba?\nIn Makkah, there's a very special building called the Kaaba. It looks like a big black cube covered with a beautiful cloth.\nThe Kaaba is super important because:\n\nIt's the first house built to worship Allah\nMuslims all over the world face toward it when they pray\nProphet Ibrahim (Abraham) and his son Ismail built it thousands of years ago\nIt's the holiest place on Earth for Muslims\n\nWhen Muslims go for Hajj, they visit the Kaaba and walk around it seven times!\nWho Goes for Hajj?\nEvery Muslim who can afford it and is healthy enough should try to go to Hajj at least once in their lifetime.\nYou can go if:\n\nYou're an adult\nYou're healthy enough to travel and walk\nYou have enough money for the trip and for your family while you're gone\nThe journey is safe\n\nYou don't have to go if:\n\nYou're too young\nYou're sick or too old\nYou don't have enough money\nIt's not safe to travel\n\nAllah knows that not everyone can go, and that's okay! He only asks people to do what they're able to do.\nWhen Is Hajj?\nHajj happens during specific days in the 12th month of the Islamic calendar (called Dhul-Hijjah). Every year, about 2-3 million Muslims from all around the world travel to Makkah at the same time!\nWhat Do People Do During Hajj?\nHajj lasts several days, and Muslims do special things:\n1. Wearing Special Clothes (Ihram)\nMen wear two simple white sheets, and women wear simple modest clothes. Everyone looks the same! You can't tell who's rich or poor, who's a king or a regular person. Everyone is equal before Allah.\n2. Walking Around the Kaaba (Tawaf)\nMuslims walk around the Kaaba seven times, praying and remembering Allah.\n3. Walking Between Two Hills (Sa'i)\nThey walk back and forth seven times between two small hills called Safa and Marwa. This remembers the story of Hajar (Prophet Ibrahim's wife) searching for water for her baby.\n4. Standing at Arafat\nThis is the most important part! All pilgrims stand on a plain called Arafat, praying to Allah from noon until sunset. It's like all the Muslims in the world are standing together in one place!\n5. Collecting Pebbles and Throwing Them\nMuslims throw small stones at three pillars. This remembers Prophet Ibrahim rejecting the devil's temptations.\n6. Celebrating Eid al-Adha\nDuring Hajj, Muslims celebrate Eid al-Adha (the Festival of Sacrifice). Families sacrifice an animal and share the meat with poor people, remembering how Prophet Ibrahim was willing to sacrifice his son for Allah.\nWhy Is Hajj So Special?\nIt Shows We're All Equal\nWhether you're rich or poor, from America or China, a doctor or a farmer - everyone wears the same simple clothes and does the same things. No one is better than anyone else!\nIt Brings Muslims Together\nImagine meeting people from every country in the world! Muslims make friends with people from different places, all united by their love for Allah.\nIt's Like Pressing the Reset Button\nThe Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said that if you do Hajj properly and sincerely, you come back as clean from sins as the day you were born! It's like starting fresh!\nIt Teaches Important Lessons\nHajj reminds Muslims of the stories of the Prophets, teaches patience (because it's hard work!), and shows how to work together and help each other.\nIt's a Practice for the Day of Judgment\nWhen all the pilgrims stand together at Arafat dressed simply and praying, it's like a practice for the Day when everyone will stand before Allah.\nWhat Should Pilgrims Remember?\nDuring Hajj, Muslims must:\n\nBe kind and patient with everyone\nNot argue or fight\nNot hurt any animals or plants\nKeep their intentions pure\nUse money earned in honest ways\nHelp other pilgrims\nStay focused on worshiping Allah\n\nA Story to Remember\nImagine being invited to the biggest, most important event in your life. You get to visit the holiest place, meet people from everywhere, and feel closer to Allah than ever before. You wear simple clothes to show that everyone is equal. You walk where Prophets walked. You pray with millions of others. When you come home, you're changed - you're a better, kinder, more grateful person!\nThat's what Hajj is like for Muslims!\nAfter Hajj\nWhen Muslims return from Hajj:\n\nThey're often called \"Hajji\" (for men) or \"Hajjah\" (for women) as a sign of respect\nThey share their experiences with family and friends\nThey try to keep the good habits they learned\nThey feel grateful to Allah for allowing them to go\nThey pray that Allah accepts their Hajj\n\nRemember!\n\nHajj is a journey to Makkah, the holiest city in Islam\nMuslims visit the Kaaba and do special acts of worship\nEveryone wears simple clothes to show they're equal\nMillions of Muslims from all over the world go together\nIt happens once a year during specific days\nOnly those who can afford it and are healthy need to go\nHajj washes away sins and makes you a better person!",

      "content": "What Is Sawm?\nSawm means fasting - not eating or drinking during the daytime for one whole month called Ramadan.\nHow does it work? Muslims wake up very early before the sun comes up to eat breakfast (this meal is called Suhoor). Then they don't eat or drink anything - not even water! - until the sun goes down. When the sun sets, they break their fast with a meal called Iftar.\nThey do this every single day for one month!\nWhat Is Ramadan?\nRamadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar. It's a super special month for Muslims because:\n\nThe Quran (Islam's holy book) was first revealed during this month\nGood deeds count extra during Ramadan\nThere's a special night called Laylat al-Qadr that's better than 1,000 months!\nFamilies and friends come together more\nEveryone tries extra hard to be good people\n\nThink of Ramadan like a special training month where Muslims practice being their very best!\nWho Has to Fast?\nMust fast:\n\nAdult Muslims (usually after puberty)\nPeople who are healthy and able to fast\n\nDon't have to fast:\n\nYoung children\nElderly people\nSick people\nPregnant women or nursing mothers\nTravelers on long journeys\nPeople who would get hurt from not eating\n\nAllah is very kind and understanding. He doesn't want anyone to get sick or hurt!\nWhy Do Muslims Fast?\nReason 1: To Feel What Hungry People Feel\nWhen you don't eat all day, you understand how poor people who don't have food feel every day. This makes you want to help them more!\nReason 2: To Practice Self-Control\nFasting teaches you to control yourself. If you can say \"no\" to food when you're hungry, you can say \"no\" to other bad things too, like being mean or telling lies.\nReason 3: To Become More Patient\nGoing without food is hard! But when you do it, you learn to be patient. This helps you be patient in other parts of life too.\nReason 4: To Get Closer to Allah\nWhen you're fasting, you think about Allah more. You pray more, read the Quran more, and try harder to be good. It's like special time with Allah!\nReason 5: To Appreciate What You Have\nWhen you finally eat after a long day of fasting, food tastes amazing! You realize how lucky you are to have food, water, and so many blessings.\nWhat Else Happens During Ramadan?\nRamadan isn't just about not eating. Muslims also:\n\nTry extra hard to be kind and helpful\nGive more money to charity\nRead the Quran every day\nPray special night prayers called Taraweeh\nSpend more time with family\nForgive people who hurt them\nStay away from bad words and bad behavior\n\nIt's like a whole month of being super good!\nSpecial Ramadan Moments\nSuhoor (Pre-Dawn Meal)\nFamilies wake up together while it's still dark outside to eat breakfast. It's special because everyone is together at a time when the world is quiet and peaceful.\nIftar (Breaking the Fast)\nWhen the sun sets, Muslims eat dates (a sweet fruit) and drink water first, just like the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) used to do. Then they pray, and then they have a big meal with family and friends. It's like a daily celebration!\nLaylat al-Qadr (The Night of Power)\nThis is the most special night of the year! It's one of the last ten nights of Ramadan. The Quran says this one night is better than 1,000 months! Muslims stay up praying and asking Allah for forgiveness.\nThe Big Celebration at the End\nWhen Ramadan ends, there's a huge celebration called Eid al-Fitr! It's like a big party where:\n\nEveryone wears new or nice clothes\nFamilies visit each other\nKids get gifts and money\nEveryone eats delicious food together\nPeople thank Allah for helping them complete the fast\n\nA Story to Remember\nImagine you're training for a big race. For one month, you practice running every single day. It's hard! Your legs hurt, you get tired, but you keep going. At the end of the month, you're so much stronger and faster!\nRamadan is like that - it's training for your heart and soul. It's hard to fast, but at the end, you're a stronger, kinder, and better person!\nRemember!\n\nSawm means fasting during Ramadan\nMuslims don't eat or drink from sunrise to sunset\nIt teaches patience, self-control, and gratitude\nNot everyone has to fast - Allah is kind and understanding\nRamadan is a special month of extra worship and kindness\nIt ends with a big celebration called Eid!",

      "content": "What Is Zakah?\nZakah means giving money or things to help poor people. It's a special kind of sharing that Allah asks Muslims to do every year.\nThink of it like this: When you have extra cookies and your friend has none, what do you do? You share! Zakah is Muslims sharing their money with people who don't have enough.\nWhy Did Allah Create Rich and Poor People?\nAllah made some people rich and some people poor for a special reason. He wants to see:\n\nWill rich people be kind and share?\nWill poor people be patient and grateful?\n\nIt's like a test to see if we have good hearts!\nWho Gives Zakah?\nMuslims who have enough money saved up for one whole year must give some of it away.\nHow much? About 2.5% of their savings. That means if someone has 100 dollars saved, they give 2.50 dollars to help others. It's a small amount, but when many people give together, it helps a lot of people!\nWho doesn't have to give? Children, poor people, and those who don't have extra money don't have to give zakah. But they can still give other small gifts (called sadaqah) when they want to help!\nWho Receives Zakah?\nZakah goes to people who really need help:\n\nPoor people who don't have enough food\nPeople who don't have homes\nPeople who can't pay their bills\nTravelers who ran out of money far from home\nPeople working to teach others about Islam\nAnd other people in need\n\nWhy Is Zakah Important?\nIt Helps Poor People\nWhen you give zakah, you help someone buy food, get clothes, or have a place to sleep. You're making their life better!\nIt Makes Your Heart Better\nSharing helps remove greedy feelings. When you give to others, you learn to be happy with what you have and not want everything for yourself.\nIt Creates Love and Friendship\nWhen rich people help poor people, it makes everyone love each other more. No one feels jealous or angry. Everyone feels like they're part of one big, caring family!\nIt Makes Communities Stronger\nImagine if everyone in your neighborhood helped each other. If someone needs food, neighbors share. If someone is sick, neighbors help. That's what zakah does - it makes the whole community strong and happy!\nIt Brings Blessings\nAllah promises that when you give zakah, He will bless the money you keep! That means Allah will make your remaining money last longer and bring you more good things.\nThe Beautiful Side of Giving\nHere's something cool: It's actually better to give zakah quietly! Allah loves it when people help others without showing off or bragging about it. It's like being a secret superhero!\nThe Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) taught that the best giving is when your left hand doesn't know what your right hand gave. That means you give so quietly that even you almost forget about it!\nWhat Happens If People Don't Give Zakah?\nWhen people have money but don't share, it causes problems:\n\nPoor people suffer more\nRich people become greedy\nPeople stop caring about each other\nThe community becomes divided\n\nBut when everyone gives zakah, the whole community becomes happy, safe, and peaceful!\nA Story to Remember\nImagine you have a big, delicious pizza. You could eat it all by yourself, but then you'd probably get a tummy ache! But if you share slices with five friends, everyone gets to enjoy the pizza, everyone is happy, and you all have fun together!\nZakah is like that - when we share what we have, everyone is happier, and Allah is pleased with us!\nRemember!\n\nZakah means sharing money with people in need\nMuslims with extra money give about 2.5% each year\nIt helps poor people and makes communities stronger\nGiving removes greedy feelings and creates love\nIt's best to give quietly without showing off\nAllah blesses those who share!",

      "content": "What Is Salah?\nSalah means prayer. It's how Muslims talk to Allah five times every single day! Just like you might talk to your parents or teachers when you need something or want to say thank you, Muslims talk to Allah through prayer.\nThe Five Daily Prayers\nMuslims pray at five special times during the day:\n\nFajr \u2600\ufe0f - Early morning, before the sun comes up\nZuhr \ud83c\udf24\ufe0f - Middle of the day, just after noon\nAsr \ud83c\udf05 - Afternoon time\nMaghrib \ud83c\udf06 - Right after the sun sets\nIsha \ud83c\udf19 - At night when it gets dark\n\nFun fact: No matter where Muslims are in the world - at home, at school, or traveling - they stop and pray at these times!\nHow Do Muslims Pray?\nWhen Muslims pray, they:\n\nFace toward the Kaaba in Makkah (a special holy place)\nStand, bow, and put their forehead on the ground\nSay special words praising Allah\nMake sure they're clean and wearing modest clothes\n\nIt's like having a special meeting with Allah five times a day!\nWhat Do Muslims Say in Prayer?\nDuring prayer, Muslims:\n\nThank Allah for all the good things they have\nAsk Allah for help with their problems\nSay sorry for any mistakes they made\nAsk Allah to bless their family and friends\nPraise Allah for being so great and kind\n\nWhy Do Muslims Pray Five Times a Day?\nReason 1: To Remember Allah\nLife gets busy! We go to school, play with friends, do homework. Prayer reminds Muslims to stop and think about Allah throughout the day.\nReason 2: To Say Thank You\nAllah gives us so many things - our families, food, homes, and health. Prayer is a time to say \"Thank you, Allah!\"\nReason 3: To Ask for Help\nEveryone needs help sometimes. When Muslims pray, they can ask Allah to help them with anything - big or small.\nReason 4: To Become Better People\nPrayer helps Muslims stay away from doing bad things. When you remember Allah is watching and you talk to Him every day, you want to be a good person!\nReason 5: To Feel Peaceful\nPrayer is like a calm, quiet time. It helps Muslims feel peaceful and happy inside, even when life is hard.\nSpecial Things About Prayer\nPrayer washes away mistakes: The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said that praying five times a day is like taking a bath in a clean river five times - it washes away all the dirt! In the same way, prayer washes away the small mistakes we make.\nPraying together is extra special: When Muslims pray together at the mosque (their place of worship), it's 27 times better than praying alone! It helps everyone feel like one big family.\nPrayer brings you closer to Allah: It's like a special phone call to Allah that's always available, any time you need it!\nA Story to Understand\nImagine your best friend moved to another country. How do you stay close to them? You call them, right? You video chat, send messages, and tell them about your day. Prayer is like that for Muslims - it's their way of staying close to Allah, talking to Him, and keeping their friendship with Him strong.\nRemember!\n\nMuslims pray five times every day\nPrayer is talking to Allah\nIt helps Muslims feel peaceful and become better people\nPrayer washes away small mistakes\nIt's like a special meeting with Allah!",

      "content": "### What Is Shahadah?\n\nShahadah is a special sentence that Muslims say and believe in their hearts. It goes like this:\n\n\"There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is His messenger.\"\n\nThis is the very first pillar of Islam, and it's the most important one! It's like the foundation of a house - everything else is built on top of it.\n\n### What Does It Mean?\n\nLet's break it down into two parts:\n\n## Part 1: \"There is no god but Allah\"\n\nThis means Muslims believe that Allah is the one and only God. Allah created everything we see:\n\n- The bright sun and shining moon\n- All the stars in the sky\n- Mountains, oceans, and rivers\n- Every animal, bird, and fish\n- All people in the world\n- You and me!\n\nAllah is the most powerful, the most kind, and the most wise. He takes care of everything.\n\n## Part 2: \"Muhammad is His messenger\"\n\nThis means Muslims believe that Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was a special teacher sent by Allah. He taught people how to live good lives and how to worship Allah in the right way.\n\nThink of it like this: If Allah sent you a letter, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was the messenger who delivered it and explained it to everyone!\n\n### How Do Muslims Show This Belief?\n\nMuslims show they believe by:\n\n- Saying the Shahadah out loud\n- Loving Allah and trying to make Him happy\n- Following the teachings of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)\n- Being thankful for all the good things Allah gives them\n- Worshipping only Allah and no one else\n\n### Why Is Shahadah So Important?\n\nShahadah is like a key that opens the door to Islam! When someone says the Shahadah and truly believes it in their heart, they become a Muslim.\n\nIt reminds Muslims:\n\n- Who created them and takes care of them\n- That Allah is always watching and knows everything\n- To be good people because Allah wants them to be kind and honest\n- That Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) showed them the best way to live\n\n### A Story to Remember\n\nImagine you have a best friend. How do people know you're best friends? You say it! You spend time together, you help each other, and you show you care. Shahadah is like telling everyone, \"Allah is my God, and I believe in His messenger!\" Then Muslims show it through their actions every single day.\n\nRemember!\n\nThe Shahadah is:\n\n- The first and most important pillar\n- A statement of belief in Allah and His messenger\n- The foundation for all other pillars\n- Something Muslims carry in their hearts always\n",

Think about a big, strong building. What holds it up? Pillars! They're like tall, strong columns that keep the building standing straight and tall.\n\nIn Islam, there are five important things that Muslims do to make their faith strong, just like pillars hold up a building. These are called the Five Pillars of Islam.\n\n### The Five Pillars Are:\n\n- Shahadah - Believing and saying what you believe\n- Salah - Praying five times every day\n- Zakah - Sharing with people who need help\n- Sawm - Fasting during the month of Ramadan\n- Hajj - Visiting the holy city of Makkah\n\n### Why Are They Important?\n\nThese five pillars help Muslims:\n\n- Stay close to Allah (God)\n- Be kind and caring to others\n- Become better people\n- Feel connected to Muslims all around the world\n- Live a happy and peaceful life\n\nThink of it this way: If you want to be good at something, you practice, right? If you want to be good at soccer, you practice kicking the ball. If you want to be good at reading, you practice reading books. The Five Pillars are like practice for being a good Muslim and a good person!\n",

Allah looks at YOU! \ud83d\udc40\n   - Allah turns His special attention to you\n   - He watches you pray\n   - He only looks away if YOU get distracted\n   - You're \"On Air\"! \ud83d\udcfa\n   - Imagine you're on TV, but Allah the King is watching you!\n   - How carefully would you pray?\n\n2. Your mistakes start falling off! \ud83c\udf43\n   - When you bow and put your head down (Ruku and Sujood), your bad deeds fall away like leaves from a tree!\n\n3. Special rules begin \ud83d\udeab\n   - No eating, drinking, or talking during prayer\n   - Why? Because you're meeting with the King of Everything!\n\n## Getting Distracted?\n\nThat's why we say \"Allahu Akbar\" again and again during prayer - to help us remember and refocus!\n\n*Think: \"Allah is watching ME right now!\"* \ud83d\udc9a",

It's a reminder: Allah is watching from above the seven heavens! Let's make our prayer beautiful for Him! \u2728\n\nHow to Bow Properly \ud83d\udcd0\n\n- Put your hands on your knees, fingers spread\n- Keep your back straight and flat (like a table!)\n- Stay calm and relaxed\n- Say: \"Subhana Rabbiyal-Atheem\" (How perfect is my Lord, the Supreme!)\n- Say it THREE times slowly with feeling! \ud83d\udc9a\n\nWhy \"MY Lord\" is Special \ud83e\udef6\n\nNotice we say \"MY Lord\" (Rabbi)?\n\nThis makes it personal! Allah is YOUR special Lord who:\n- Raised you \ud83d\udc76\n- Feeds you \ud83c\udf4e\n- Clothes you \ud83d\udc55\n- Heals you when you're sick \ud83e\ude79\n- Takes care of you always! \ud83d\udc95\n\nFeel that connection!\n\nRukuu is SUPER Important! \ud83c\udf1f\n\nSome people think rukuu isn't as special as reading Quran or putting your head down (sujood). WRONG!\n\nRukuu shows we are Allah's servants! It shows we are humble before Him!\n\nLong ago, proud people REFUSED to bow because they didn't want to be humble! One companion even asked if he could skip rukuu - but NO! It's a must!\n\nOur Greatest Need \ud83c\udfaf\n\nDid you know? Everyone has a special need inside them - the need to WORSHIP something!\n\nThroughout history, people worshiped:\n- Idols \ud83d\uddff\n- The sun \u2600\ufe0f\n- Animals \ud83d\udc04\n- Money \ud83d\udcb0\n- Even their own desires! \ud83d\ude2e\n\nBut ONLY worshiping Allah truly satisfies this need!\n\nRukuu is a BIG part of satisfying this need! When you bow properly, your heart feels happy and complete! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nDon't Rush! \ud83d\udc0c\n\nProphet Muhammad saw someone rushing through prayer - up, down, up, down like a chicken pecking! \ud83d\udc14\n\nHe said: \"If this person dies praying like this, he's not following my way!\"\n\nTake your time! Stay in rukuu long enough to feel calm and peaceful. Some companions stayed in rukuu as long as they stood reading Quran!\n\nLike Being Hungry \ud83c\udf54\n\nThe Prophet said: \"Someone who doesn't bow properly is like a starving person who eats only one or two dates - it doesn't satisfy their hunger at all!\"\n\nIf you rush, you miss the good feeling that prayer gives you!\n\n17 Times a Day! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nWe bow 17 times every day in our five prayers!\n\nEach time we bow, our love for Allah should grow!\n\nAnd when we love Allah, He loves us back even MORE - because He's the Most Kind and Generous!\n\nAnd when Allah loves you, who can ever hurt you? \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9a\n\n*Remember: Bow slowly, feel your heart connect with Allah, and enjoy this special moment! \ud83c\udf08\ud83e\udd32*",

This part is SUPER important!\n\nProphet Muhammad said: \"Allah doesn't accept your prayer if you don't stand up straight between rukuu and sujood!\"\n\nSo:\n- Stand up completely straight \ud83d\udccf\n- Stay calm and still \ud83d\ude0c\n- Let your bones settle back in place\n- Don't rush! (The Prophet stood here as long as he was in rukuu!)\n\nRushing through prayer = Stealing from your own prayer! \ud83d\udeab\n\n\"Sami Allahu Liman Hamidah!\" \ud83c\udfb5\n\nWhen we stand up, we say something different this time:\n\"Sami Allahu Liman Hamidah\" (Allah hears those who praise Him!)\n\nWhy Do We Say This? \ud83e\udd14\n\nBecause we're about to go into SUJOOD - the GREATEST part of prayer! \ud83c\udf1f\n\nIn sujood:\n\u2728 You're the closest to Allah you can EVER be!\n\u2728 Your prayers (duaa) are ALWAYS answered!\n\nAnd remember: Before asking a King for something, you should praise him first! (Just like in Al-Fatiha, we praised Allah before asking for guidance!)\n\nSo this is our signal: \"Get ready to PRAISE Allah before sujood!\"\n\nHow We Praise! \ud83d\udc9a\n\nWhen we stand, we say:\n\"Rabbana wa lakal-hamd\" (Our Lord, all praise belongs to You!)\n\nWant to add more? Say:\n\"Hamdan katheeran tayyiban mubarakan feeh!\" (Abundant, beautiful, blessed praise!)\n\nCool Story: \ud83d\ude2e One companion said these extra words during prayer. When they finished, the Prophet asked, \"Who said that?\"\n\nThe man said, \"Me!\"\n\nThe Prophet smiled and said: \"I just saw over 30 angels racing to see who could write it down first!\"\n\nImagine angels competing to record YOUR good words! \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udc7c\u2728\n\nEven MORE Praise! \ud83c\udf0c\n\nYou can also say:\n\"Praise that fills the heavens, fills the earth, fills everything between them, and fills everything else You have created!\"\n\nWhat's the \"everything else\"? Things we can't even imagine - like Allah's Throne, and all His amazing creation we don't know about!\n\nWe're saying: \"Allah, You're SO great, we can't even imagine how great You are!\" \ud83e\udd2f\n\nWe Can NEVER Praise Allah Enough! \ud83d\udc8e\n\nNo matter how much we praise Allah, it's never enough!\n\nWhy? Because Allah has qualities and greatness that:\n- We can't imagine\n- We've never been told about\n- Are beyond our understanding\n- Only Allah knows about Himself!\n\nOnly ALLAH can praise Himself the way He truly deserves! \ud83d\udc51\n\nBut we try our best with love in our hearts! \ud83d\udc95\n\n*Remember - Stand straight, praise Allah BIG, and get ready for the most special part - SUJOOD! \ud83c\udf1f\ud83e\udd32*",

Up high, close to Allah! \ud83c\udf1f\n- Where is Hell? Down low, far from Allah \ud83d\udd25\n- What's the HIGHEST place in Paradise?\n  Al-Firdaus Al-A'la (the highest Paradise!)\n  Its ceiling touches Allah's Throne!\n  That's where Prophet Muhammad lives!\n  Your neighbor there is ALLAH HIMSELF! \ud83d\ude2e\ud83d\udc51\n- Where does happiness come from?

Let's learn exactly how HE did it!\n\nStep-by-Step Guide \ud83d\udc63\n\n1. Going Down \u2b07\ufe0f\n   - Say \"Allahu Akbar\" WHILE going down (not before or after!)\n   - Put your hands down FIRST, then knees (don't go down like a camel!)\n\n2. Position on the Ground \ud83e\udd32\n   - Put your forehead AND nose firmly on the ground\n   - No hat or scarf should block your forehead from touching the floor!\n   - Keep your fingers together, pointing toward Makkah\n   - Keep elbows UP (off the ground and away from your body)\n   - Don't let your tummy touch your legs\n\n3. Seven Body Parts Touch the Ground: 7\ufe0f\u20e3\n   - Forehead (with nose)\n   - Right hand\n   - Left hand\n   - Right knee\n   - Left knee\n   - Right foot (toes)\n   - Left foot (toes)\n   - Stay still and calm - don't rush!\n\nWhat to Say in Sujood? \ud83d\udde3\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9a\n\nThe Prophet NEVER recited Quran in sujood - he made DUAA (prayers) instead!\n\nWhy? Because this is when you're CLOSEST to Allah! This is the BEST time to ask for things!\n\nBasic Dhikr:\n\"Subhana Rabbiyal-A'la\" (How perfect is my Lord, the Most High!)\n\nSay it 3 times or MORE!\n\nIsn't it beautiful? We're down LOW, but praising Allah who is SO HIGH! \u2b07\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f\n\nAdd More Praise! \u2728\n\n\"Subhanaka Allahumma Rabbana wa bihamdik, Allahumma ighfirli\" (How perfect You are O Allah, our Lord! I praise You! O Allah, forgive me!)\n\n\"Subboohun Quddoosun, Rabbul-mala'ikati war-ruuh\" (Perfect and Holy is He, Lord of the angels and Angel Jibreel!)\n\nThe Prophet taught us MANY different things to say - each one helps us focus better!\n\nTalk to Allah! \ud83d\udcac\u2764\ufe0f\n\nDuaa = Talking to Allah\n\nWhen you love someone, you want to talk to them MORE and LONGER, right?\n\nBeautiful Story about Prophet Musa (Moses): \ud83c\udfd4\ufe0f\n\nAllah was talking to Musa. Musa was SO happy listening to Allah's voice!\n\nThen Allah asked him: \"What's that in your hand, Musa?\"\n\nMusa was SO excited and comfortable that he started talking A LOT: \"It's my staff! I lean on it, I use it to get leaves for my sheep, and I have other uses for it too...\"\n\nHe just wanted to keep talking to Allah because it felt SO GOOD! \ud83d\udc9a\n\nThat's how YOU should feel in sujood! Talk to Allah, praise Him, ask Him for things, tell Him your problems!\n\nSpecial Duaa to Say: \ud83e\udd32\n\n\"O Allah! I seek Your pleasure, not Your anger. I seek Your forgiveness, not Your punishment. I seek protection in You, from You. I can never praise You enough - You are as You have praised Yourself!\"\n\n(Don't worry if you can't memorize this yet - just talk to Allah in your own words!)\n\nWhy TWO Sujoods? \ud83e\udd14\n\nWe bow (rukuu) once in each unit of prayer...\nBut we do sujood TWICE!\n\nWhy? Because sujood is SO special and SO important - once is just not enough! We need to do it twice to really enjoy it! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nTake Your Time! \ud83d\udc0c\ud83d\udc95\n\nThe Prophet used to stay in sujood for a LONG time, enjoying these precious moments with Allah!\n\n(Fun fact: His little grandchildren would sometimes climb on his back while he was in sujood, and he wouldn't get up until they were done playing!) \ud83d\udc76\ud83c\udfa0\n\nRemember:\n- 7 body parts on the ground\n- Stay calm and still\n- Say \"Subhana Rabbiyal-A'la\" at least 3 times\n- TALK to Allah - He's listening! \ud83d\udc42\ud83d\udc9a\n- Take your time - enjoy being close to Allah!\n\nThis is your special moment with the King of Everything! \ud83d\udc51\u2728",

This position has a VERY special meaning!\n\nWhat Does This Position Mean? \ud83d\udcad\n\nThis sitting position is like:\n\n1. On Judgment Day: \ud83d\ude28\n   Everyone will be brought down to their knees, scared and humble, waiting to hear about all the things they did in life!\n   The Quran says: \"Today you will face everything you ever did!\" (45:28-29)\n\n2. In this life: \u2696\ufe0f\n   Like someone waiting to hear a scary sentence from a judge - desperately hoping for forgiveness and mercy!\n\nWhat Do We Say? \ud83d\udde3\ufe0f\n\nIn this desperate position, we need these words MORE than anything:\n\n\"Rabbi ighfirli!\" (My Lord, forgive me!)\n\nSay it 2, 3, 4 times or MORE! \ud83d\ude4f\n\nWhy? Because we've done SO many wrong things! We've broken Allah's rules many times! We REALLY need His forgiveness!\n\nThe Prophet's Special Duaa \ud83d\udc9a\n\nThe Prophet used to sit here as LONG as he was in sujood, asking for forgiveness and saying:\n\n\"O Allah:\n- Forgive me \u2728\n- Have mercy on me \ud83d\udc95\n- Guide me \ud83e\udded\n- Make me rich (in heart and blessings) \ud83d\udcb0\n- Give me health \ud83c\udfe5\n- Provide for me \ud83c\udf4e\n- Raise me in rank!\" \ud83d\udcc8\n\n(This asks for blessings in THIS life AND the next life!)\n\nBeautiful Story - Judgment Day \ud83d\udcd6\n\nOn Judgment Day, while everyone is scared and waiting:\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad will go into a LONG sujood before Allah's Throne...\n- Praising Allah \ud83c\udf1f\n- Glorifying Allah \ud83d\udc51\n- Praying \ud83e\udd32\n- CRYING for US - his people! \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\udc9a\n\nThen Allah will say: \"Lift your head, O Muhammad! Ask and it will be granted! Intercede and it will be accepted!\"\n\nThe Prophet will sit up (in THIS position!) and start asking Allah to forgive and help US!\n\nHe's STILL thinking about us! \ud83d\udc95\n\nThis Teaches Us: \ud83d\udcda\n\nPrayers can be answered:\n- When we're in sujood \u2705\n- When we're sitting after sujood \u2705\n\nBoth positions are special!\n\nThen... Another Sujood! \ud83d\udd04\n\nAfter sitting and begging for forgiveness, we do ANOTHER sujood!\n\nWhy? Because we need to get even CLOSER to Allah! One sujood wasn't enough! We need TWO! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc9a\n\nBeautiful Pattern \ud83c\udfa8\n\nNotice the pattern:\n- Al-Fatiha (first chapter of Quran): Starts with \"Read!\" and ends with \"Guide us!\"\n- Our prayer unit: Starts with recitation (reading Quran) and ends with prostration (sujood)!\n\nEverything in Islam has beautiful patterns! \u2728\n\nRemember: \ud83c\udf1f\n\n\"Are those who KNOW equal to those who DON'T know?\" (Quran 39:9)\n\nNO! The more we learn about prayer, the more we FEEL it and LOVE it!\n\nWhen you sit between sujoods:\n- Imagine you're on Judgment Day \ud83d\ude30\n- BEG Allah to forgive you! \ud83d\ude4f\n- Say \"Rabbi ighfirli!\" from your HEART! \ud83d\udc94\u27a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9a\n- Then go back down for another beautiful sujood! \ud83e\udd32\u2728",

He gets SO angry and flees!\n\nGood news: Since he's gone, it's easier for you to focus in prayer! \ud83d\udcaa\u2728\n\nSecret to HUGE Rewards! \ud83c\udf81\ud83d\udcb0\n\nThe Mu'adhin (person calling adhan) gets the reward of EVERYONE who prays because of his call!\n\nExample: If 100 people pray, he gets rewards for 100 prayers! \ud83d\ude2e\n\nYOUR secret: To get the same rewards, just REPEAT after the Mu'adhin!\n\nImagine repeating the Adhan in Makkah where millions pray!

ALLAH is more important than ALL of it! It's time to meet Him now! \ud83d\udc51\n\n\"Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah\"\nMeaning: I testify there is no god except Allah!\n\nFor YOU alone, O Allah, I leave everything behind!\n\n(If you ignore the call to prayer, it's like saying other things are more important than Allah! \ud83d\ude22)\n\n\"Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasulullah\"\nMeaning: I testify that Muhammad is Allah's messenger!\n\nWhen we pray, we follow the Prophet's example!\n\nTwo rules for good deeds:\n1.

Follow the Prophet's way (do it the RIGHT way!) \u2705\n\nBoth are needed! \u2696\ufe0f\n\nCool Fact About the Prophet! \ud83c\udf0d\n\nMuslims live ALL OVER the world!

Repeat after the Mu'adhin! \ud83d\udce2\ud83d\udc95\n\n\"Hayya 'alas-Salah!\"\nMeaning: Come to prayer!\n\nDON'T repeat this! Instead say:\n\"La hawla wa la quwwata illa billah\" (I have no power except what Allah gives me!)\n\nWe're saying: \"I can't do this without Your help, Allah!\"\n\n(Just like in Al-Fatiha: first we say worship is for Allah, then we ask for His help!) \ud83e\udd32\n\n\"Hayya 'alal-Falah!\"\nMeaning: Come to SUCCESS!\n\nThis is SO exciting! Prayer = SUCCESS in this life AND the next! \ud83c\udf89\u2728\n\nIf prayer guarantees my success, how can I NOT jump up and pray?!\n\nAgain, say: \"La hawla wa la quwwata illa billah\" (All my power comes from Allah!)\n\n\"La ilaha illallah\"\nMeaning: There is no god except Allah!\n\nThe Adhan ends like it started - reminding us:\n- Leave this world (Dunya) - Allah is greater!\n- Focus on the next life (Akhirah) - the REAL life! \ud83c\udf08\n\nHow Should You Feel? \ud83d\udc95\n\nWhen you hear Adhan, feel like:\nA child waiting at the airport for their mom to come home! \ud83d\udeeb\n\nThen the announcement: \"Her flight just landed!\"\n\nTHAT'S how excited you should be! Your meeting with Allah is almost here! \ud83d\ude0a\u2728\n\nRush to Prayer! \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udca8\n\nWhen you love someone, you want to meet them quickly!\n\nProphet Musa said to Allah: \"I rushed to You, my Lord, so You may be pleased!\"\n\nDon't delay! When you hear Adhan, hurry to prayer! Time to meet the One you love! \ud83d\udc9a\n\nThe Sad Reality \ud83d\ude22\n\nToday, many people hear Adhan but don't even notice it - it just fades into background noise of their busy lives.\n\nBut now YOU know better!\n\nAdhan is powerful! It changes how you see your whole life! \ud83c\udf1f\n\nRemember:\n- Repeat after the Mu'adhin for huge rewards! \ud83c\udf81\n- Shaytan runs away during Adhan! \ud83d\ude08\ud83c\udfc3\n- Prayer = meeting with Allah = SUCCESS! \u2705\n- Feel excited - your Beloved is calling you! \ud83d\udc95\n\nNext time you hear Adhan, jump up with joy!

Bring Your HEART! \ud83d\udc9a\n   Your heart MUST be in it!\n   \n   How? Before prayer, spend 10 minutes thinking about your love for Allah.\n   \n   Forget the world - there's 23+ hours for that! Give these 10 minutes to Allah!\n   \n   Did you know? You're ONLY rewarded for the parts of prayer you're focused on! \ud83d\ude2e\n   \n   If you can focus on a 2-hour movie, you can focus on 10 minutes of prayer! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n2.

Come with HOPE (Rajaa')! \ud83c\udf1f\n   Hope = A deep feeling that Allah will:\n   - Show you mercy \ud83d\udc95\n   - Forgive you \u2728\n   - Accept you \ud83e\udd17\n   - Love you \ud83d\udc9a\n   - Bring you close to Him \ud83e\udec2\n   \n   Note: Hope is different from \"wishing!\"\n   Hope = Action! You work for what you hope for!\n   \n   Allah says:\n   \"Call upon Me; I will answer you!\" (40:60)\n   \"O My servants who have sinned against themselves, DON'T despair of Allah's Mercy - Allah forgives ALL sins!\" (39:53)\n\n4. Feel Allah's HAYBA (Awe)! \ud83d\ude2e\ud83d\udc51\n   Hayba = Fear + Awe + Deep respect when standing before someone SO GREAT!\n   \n   Think about:\n   - Allah's names: The Mighty, The Compeller, The Avenger\n   - Everything is under His control!\n   - Who are WE to disobey His commands?! \ud83d\ude30\n   \n   There are angels who have been bowing and prostrating since they were created, saying: \"We have NOT worshiped You as You deserve!\"\n   \n   On the night journey, Angel Jibreel was shaking like a worn-out cloth from fear of Allah!\n   \n   The more you know about Allah (and yourself compared to Him), the more Hayba you'll feel!\n\n5.

You have Khushu' (the treasure), but not enough guards yet!\n\nSo Shaytan tries to distract you to steal your prayer's worth!\n\nGood news: As you practice these secrets, you'll become like the king's palace - TOO guarded for Shaytan to steal from! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\n\nWhen Do You Feel the MOST Khushu'? \ud83e\udd14\n\nRamadan! Especially during Taraweeh (night prayers)!\n\nSpecifically? During the duaa at the end - when everyone raises their hands, says \"Ameen,\" and cries! \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\udc9a\n\nWhy that moment? Because you suddenly FEEL that you're talking to SOMEONE! You realize you're having a CONVERSATION with ALLAH!\n\nThe BIG Secret! \ud83d\udd10\ud83d\udcac\n\nMost people think prayer is a MONOLOGUE (just you talking)\n\nBut prayer is a DIALOGUE!
